# Cows and Bulls Game
### An Interactive Code-Breaking Challenge Against the Computer

## Introduction
Cows and Bulls is a classic code-breaking game where the player tries to guess a number generated by the computer. In this interactive Python version, not only does the player attempt to guess the computer's number, but the computer also uses logic to guess the player's number.

## Game Features
- **Interactive Guessing:** Play against the computer by guessing the number it has thought of.
- **Computer as Opponent:** The computer guesses your number using a logical algorithm, making for a challenging opponent.
- **Bulls and Cows Indicators:** After each guess, receive hints in the form of "bulls" (correct digits in the correct place) and "cows" (correct digits but in the wrong place) to guide your next guess.

## How to Play
- Start the game and think of a 4-digit number with all unique digits. The computer will do the same.
- Guess the computer's number. The computer will provide feedback in the form of "bulls" and "cows" using the format "xByS", where:
  - "x" is the number of Bulls (correct digits in the correct place).
  - "y" is the number of Cows (correct digits but in the wrong place).
- Provide feedback to the computer's guesses using the format "xBxS", where:
  For example, if your number is `1234` and the computer guesses `1245`, you should respond with "2B1S" since there are 2 Bulls (digits '1' and '2') and 1 Cow (digit '4').
- The game continues until either the player or the computer successfully guesses the number.
